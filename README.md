# Matsumata2025
These are the python codes used for the data analysis of the fiber photometry experiments in Matsumata et al., Current Biology 2025. 
The codes here were used to parse .doric files to be used for further anaylsis using GuPPy, an open-source Python-based fiber photometry data analysis software.
